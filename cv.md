## Goal
My nickname is Coddy Vandler. And my really name is Jam. Yeah, it's sweety. I am attracted to difficulties. I want to study something that was previously unknown to me. Not just to learn the material, but also to apply it correctly in practice. This is how I stepped into the IT sphere and found love for this case. I will work hard and reach personal heights. Believe in me and I will amaze you.
## Skills
I have knowledge. However, they are not enough to work in a large IT company. And I will definitely replenish my level during this course. But I won't stop there.
Now I know a little about HTML markup, JS, code reading. But I have such skills as perseverance and love of work.
## Education
My education has nothing close to this area.
## Language
I've always loved English. Since the age of 15, she has been actively studying self-education. Already now I speak with native speakers, understand speech, write in English, watch movies for fun, listen and write music. My level is A2.
